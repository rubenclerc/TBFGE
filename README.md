# TBFGE
Team builder for Genshin Impact is an application which builds Genshin Impact teams for you. My aim with this application was to learn C# and create a first project with Visual Studio 2019.

## Prerequisites
* XAMPP: to start a local web server. You can download it here -> <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/fr/index.html" target="_blank">Download XAMPP</a>

## Installation
1. Download the file <a href="https://github.com/rubenclerc/TBFGE/blob/main/bdd.sql">bdd.sql</a>
2. Download the /TBFGE v1.0 directory
3. Open XAMPP and start "Apache" and "MySQL"
4. Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/, paste bdd.sql into the SQL section and execute the script
5. Now you can use the application

## How to use
1. Open XAMPP and start "Apache" and "MySQL"
2. In the TBFGE v1.0 directory, start teamBuilderForGenshinImpact.exe
3. Add your characters and select your elementary resonance
4. Now you have your team!

## Warning
The bdd.sql file is not up to date since the 2.0 update of Genshin Impact.

NB: Close the application by clicking on the "Close app" button if you wouldn't have problems later.
